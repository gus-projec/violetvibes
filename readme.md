## Website auditing
- SEOptime audit: https://www.seoptimer.com/gus-projec.github.io#backlinks50852594
- As per above report, these issues were found:
  - Reasonably weak level of backlink activity 
  - Backlinks are links from other websites pointing to your site. To improve this, these would need to be implemented:
    - Pay for one of market sites like: Ahrefs, Moz Link Explorer and SEMRush
    - Leverage Social Media
    - Collaborate with Influencers and Bloggers
    - Add the website to relevant directories, such as https://www.allmusic.com/
    - Engage in Guest Blogging
    - Partner with Local Businesses
    - Press Releases
    - Sponsor Events
    - Forums and Communities
  - Use of Mobile Viewports
    - The meta viewport tag tells browsers how to display content on different devices. Without it, mobile devices may not properly adjust the layout, leading to poor usability.
    - This is a false positive. I've reviewed each html page and the "metaviewport" tag is already placed within the head tag. This is the head tag on each html page:
    

```html
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Violet Vibes Festival - Lineup</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
  <link rel="icon" href="images/favicon.png" type="image/png">
</head>


  - No DMARC Record
      - In order to be able to add the DMARC Record, I registered the domain with [namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/)
      - I was able to add the DMARC Record, according to this: [dmarcian](https://dmarcian.com/how-to-publish-a-dmarc-record/)
      - Below is the host configuration on namecheap:
      ![Alt Text](https://github.com/gus-projec/violetvibes/blob/main/documents/DNS_configuration.png)
      - We can verify that the DMARC was identified on [MXToolBox](https://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx?action=dmarc%3avioletvibesfestival.com&run=toolpage#)


  - No SPF Record
